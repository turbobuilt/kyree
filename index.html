                    The main religion in Morocco is Islam, which is the state religion, although freedom of religious
                    belief is also guaranteed to all. Officially, 99% of the population are Muslims, and virtually all
                    of those
                    are Sunni.

                    Historically, Mongolian Shamanism and Buddhism have been the two dominant religions in Mongolia with
                    most indigenous Mongols adhering to these religions. In the 13th century, Mongol Empire's rule in
                    the region, foreign invasions by the empire exposed the Mongols to Islam and Christianity.

                <p>I picked these two countries to help build them as people who matter. They are battling with
                    self-confidence lack of knowledge. Being misunderstood i want to be able to bring new beginnings
                    into their lives. I want to shower them with love, care and support i want to be the ear they cry
                    out to
                    and they get what they deserve. I want them to know that they could have the same support as the
                    united
                    states. I want them to feel thought of. I want to be courageous to their needs and understandings.
